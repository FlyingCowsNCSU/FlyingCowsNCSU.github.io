# Raspberry Pi Payload Plate Attachment

This README.md file documents the process of attaching a Raspberry Pi to a payload plate and powering it using a buck boost converter. The steps involved in this process are as follows:

1. Attach the Raspberry Pi to the Payload Plate
2. Attach the Buck Boost Converter to the Base Plate
3. Connect the Drone Output Raw Battery Voltage to the Power Converter
4. Power the Raspberry Pi via the 5V and GND Pins

## Step 1: Attach the Raspberry Pi to the Payload Plate

To attach the Raspberry Pi to the payload plate, follow these steps:

1. Place the Raspberry Pi on the payload plate in the desired location
2. Attach the Powerboard to the Raspberry Pi and ensure that it is fastened
3. Secure the Raspberry Pi to the payload plate using screws or other appropriate fasteners
4. Ensure that the Raspberry Pi is securely attached to the payload plate and that there is no movement or play in the connection

## Step 2: Attach the Buck Boost Converter to the Base Plate

To attach the buck boost converter to the base plate, follow these steps:

1. Place the buck boost converter on the base plate in the desired location
2. Secure the buck boost converter to the base plate using screws or other appropriate fasteners
3. Ensure that the buck boost converter is securely attached to the base plate and that there is no movement or play in the connection

## Step 3: Connect the Drone Output Raw Battery Voltage to the Power Converter

To connect the drone output raw battery voltage to the power converter, follow these steps:

1. Identify the wires coming from the drone output raw battery voltage
2. Connect the positive wire to the input of the buck boost converter
3. Connect the negative wire to the ground (GND) of the buck boost converter

## Step 4: Power the Raspberry Pi via the 5V and GND Pins

To power the Raspberry Pi via the 5V and GND pins, follow these steps:

1. Identify the 5V and GND pins on the Raspberry Pi
2. Connect the 5V pin to the output of the buck boost converter
3. Connect the GND pin to the ground (GND) of the buck boost converter
4. Power on the drone and verify that the Raspberry Pi is receiving power
