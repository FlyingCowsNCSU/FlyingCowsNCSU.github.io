### Welcome to our main repository!

We are the Flying Cows, and this is the main repo/website for the Camera Trap project for ECE 492/592: Introduction to Autonomous Systems. Our project report is available as a pdf [here](https://github.com/FlyingCowsNCSU/FlyingCowsNCSU.github.io/blob/main/FlyingCows_CameraTrap_FinalReport%20-%20Google%20Docs.pdf). To view our source code and documentation, look in the `src` folder.

**Note**: We don't have anything in the `bin` executables folder. We used Python to run our code on the drone, and the Arduino framework to develop code on the camera trap. To run our code, please follow the instructions on the Software section of [this page](https://flyingcowsncsu.github.io/).
