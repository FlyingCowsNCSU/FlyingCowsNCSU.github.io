<h1>Practical Problems</h1>
<p>-Sending Images: Our first issue prior to the field testing was being able to send images from the camera to the raspberry pi. Due to the size or the capacity of the picture the picture that was stored on the esp32 either became distorted or was unable to open. As a result of this we messed around with the type of photo and how it was stored (jpeg, png, jpg). We then tested to see if its a code issue by simulating the code through a SITL setup. After a couple of changes to the overall image size and bits that are stored the images were able to send properly in its original state. </p>

<p>-Vrone Simulations: Using the vrone in order to debug and simulate what a drone in the field would do became an outlying problem. When trying to run the simulation on the Vrone our group kept getting the "mode (0)" prompt which gave us an indication that our script was not able to run. After doing many tests and even resetting our raspberry pi completely we were informed to switch and try to simulate using a different Vrone. Once switching we realized that the problem did not reside in our setup or script but it was the flight controller on the vrone that posed the "mode(0)" problem. </p>

<p>-Socket Connection: While we were at the field we had a problem where the camera would not connect to the raspberry pi which was on the drone. This made it so that images were not able to transfer and the drone. The flight was orginially setup so that the drone would return to launch (RTL) whenver the pictures were sent over. In order to test we created a timer which would allow the drone to RTL after a fixed amount of time if there was no connection attempted. After the drone initiated RTL, we understood that it was a connection problem and not the problem with the actual drone. After looking through the code the camera trsp team realized that the port number that was opened by the socket of the drone did not match that in the camera which was the reason why there was no connection.</p>

<p>-Camera Delay: After resolving the issue of the connection we ran into the problem of the camera not being able to take photos without a delay. Ofcourse we were not expecting to have 0 delay due the hardware and the cost effective items that were used, but we wanted to be able to make it so that it had the least amount of delay as possible. The way we resolved or just improved the delay was repositioning the camera and rechecking the soldering to ensure there was no bindings with the pins. After donig these two things we were able to lower the delay and was able to capture a person or animal walking past it. </p>

<p> Advice for next years students: Although a project of this caliber can be scary, trust in your experience and let this class be a way for you to be able to take what you learn and apply it in a hands on enviroment. Do not give up when approached by a problem and trust in yourself and your teamates. Lastly do not be afraid to ask for help, the professors and the TA's are here to learn and grow with you! </p>
