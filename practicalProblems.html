  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
      <p><strong>Sending Images:</strong> Our first issue prior to the field testing was being able to send images from
        the camera to the Raspberry Pi. Due to the size or the capacity of the picture, the picture that was stored on
        the ESP32 either became distorted or was unable to open. As a result of this, we experimented with the type of
        photo and how it was stored (jpeg, png, jpg). We then tested to see if it was a code issue by simulating the
        code through a SITL setup. After making several changes to the overall image size and bits that are stored, the
        images were able to send properly in their original state.</p>

      <p><strong>Vrone Simulations:</strong> Using the Vrone to debug and simulate what a drone in the field would do
        became an outlying problem. When trying to run the simulation on the Vrone, our group kept getting the "mode
        (0)" prompt, which indicated that our script was not able to run. After conducting many tests and even resetting
        our Raspberry Pi completely, we were advised to switch and try to simulate using a different Vrone. Once we
        switched, we realized that the problem did not reside in our setup or script, but it was the flight controller
        on the Vrone that posed the "mode(0)" problem.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Socket Connection:</strong> While we were at the field, we had a problem where the camera would not
        connect to the Raspberry Pi on the drone. This prevented image transfer and the drone. The flight was originally
        set up so that the drone would return to launch (RTL) whenever the pictures were sent over. In order to test, we
        created a timer which would allow the drone to RTL after a fixed amount of time if no connection was attempted.
        After the drone initiated RTL, we understood that it was a connection problem and not an issue with the actual
        drone. After reviewing the code, the camera team realized that the port number opened by the socket of the drone
        did not match that in the camera, which was the reason why there was no connection.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Camera Delay:</strong> After resolving the connection issue, we faced the problem of the camera not
        being able to take photos without a delay. Of course, we were not expecting to have zero delay due to the
        hardware and cost-effective items used, but we wanted to minimize the delay as much as possible. We resolved or
        improved the delay by repositioning the camera and rechecking the soldering to ensure there were no issues with
        the pins. After doing these two things, we were able to reduce the delay and capture a person or animal walking
        past it.</p>

  <p><em>***Advice for next year's students:</em> Although a project of this caliber can be intimidating, trust in your
    experience and let this class be a way for you to apply what you've learned in a hands-on environment. Don't give up
    when faced with a problem, and trust in yourself and your teammates. Lastly, don't be afraid to ask for help; the
    professors and TAs are here to learn and grow with you!</p>
