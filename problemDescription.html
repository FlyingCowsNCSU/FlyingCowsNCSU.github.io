<h1 align="center"> Camera Trap </h1>

<p> The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate a drone that is able to visit one (or several) camera traps, see if they have images on them, and if yes, download the images and physically carry them to the GCS. Obviously, you'll need to design the camera trap and drone to work with each other. The hardest things is to have the camera trap power efficient: most of the time it has to sleep and do nothing, but then wake up fast on two different events:
  </p><ul>
	<li> If an animal walks in view, and
	</li><li> If the drone comes by
  </li></ul>
  

<h3> Current Status </h3>

There is a great start documented <a href="cameraTrapProgress.docx">here</a>.


<p>To successfully complete this project you need to have:
</p><ul>
<li> Ability to fly a drone.
</li><li> Embedded systems for the camera trap.
</li><li> Programming (Python/C).
</li></ul>

<h3> Deliverables </h3>

<ul>
<li> Demonstration 
</li><li> Well commented code and schematics
</li><li> Documentation for the resulting system
</li><li> Report
</li></ul>
